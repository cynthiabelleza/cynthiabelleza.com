Creating User-Friendly Documentation

<!--more-->

* **My role**: UX Writer

* **Employed by**: National Council of Public Prosecutors (CNMP)

Being passionate about organization, I always had the habit of documenting all the information that was relayed to me about how every task was done before. In the process of acquiring this data, Iinquired about every step, to assess their necessity and if there were improvements that could be made to streamline them.

As a result, I created guides for most of the tasks I was involved in, even the occasional ones.

When I noticed that they were beneficial to my coworkers, I decided to improve them with screenshots and tested the result with other people who never perform these tasks to evaluate how they improved the execution of the processes.

After noticing the improvements resulting from my work, my skip manager tasked me with reviewing documents most accessed by the staff such as the HR Manual and the Remote Work Directive.
