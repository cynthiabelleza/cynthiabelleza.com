Working to define a good information architecture on the use of the software Tableau by the HR Team

<!--more-->

* **My role**: Information Architecture

* **Employed by**: National Council of Public Prosecutors (CNMP)

The organization acquired financial means to buy licenses of the business intelligence software Tableau, and two of them were received by the HR sector, where I work.

First, we researched the data necessities from each HR subdivision through interviews and questionnaires. After recording that on paper, we are listing all the data elements needed for each operation in each subdivision. We consolidate the data we retrieved in a spreadsheet and suggest alterations, such as label names and comments, to be added to Tableau.

After analyzing the data requested by HR, we ask for their inclusion on the Tableau HR View to the IT team. When done, we will proceed with tests and, if everything is satisfactory, pass to the next data group.

Currently, we are waiting for the inclusion of new data related to Staff Licenses in the HR View.
