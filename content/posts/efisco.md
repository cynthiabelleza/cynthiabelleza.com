A usability evaluation on financial context

<!--more-->

* **My role**: Usability Coordination, Heuristic Evaluation, Facilitator

* **Employed by**: Laboratory of Evaluation of Software Products (LAPS)

The Secretaria da Fazenda do Estado de Pernambuco (Sefaz) has as mission to provide and manage the necessary financial resources for the implementation of public politics in state of Pernambuco. One of its roles is to inspect the use of these financial resources. Currently this is being done through the    e-fisco system.  

Sefaz asked LAPS for a usability evaluation of the system. Our proposal was to work in two ways: solo and with users. We started with heuristic evaluation to better understand the interface issues, and then we planned usability tests with six users – and another six observers of Sefaz that wanted to learn more about usability – and a focus group after the tests.

The evaluation found more than just issues… it found voices that wanted to be listened to and a better understanding about what the system was supposed to do for its users.
