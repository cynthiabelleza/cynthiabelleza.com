CESAR’s van tracking system.

<!--more-->

* **My role**: Concept Development, User Experience Research

* **Employed by**: Recife Center for Advanced Studies and Systems (CESAR)

This tracking system was idealized by CESAR’s embedded systems group to ally its users to know van’s arrival time. Besides the hardware, the project manager asked usability group to research about the user experience to propose an interaction design.

The first step was to plan in accordance with available time (just three days): one for user recruitment and the others for interviews and focus group. Recruitment was made by web messenger and in person: four to focus group and six to interviews.

The results showed unexpected problems like delays caused by user’s calls asking the driver to wait and lack of space to parking in some buildings. Considering this, we paper prototyped the two system components – web and messenger – and are planning a meeting with the different stakeholders responsible for the van to discuss operation improvements not related to the software.
