From social to collaboration: a collaborative system to support research groups

<!--more-->

* **Abstract**: 

More and more the speech about the importance of shared and integrated knowledge is  being  heard,  be  it  in  a  company  or  even  in  the  academic  world.  Deriving  from  the 
necessity  of  making  information  exchange  means  available,  came  the  collaborative systems.  However,  the  options  for  fomenting  scientific  production  and  the  formation  of 
knowledge networks among researchers are scarce, be it in local or global form. 
The  objective  of this work  is  to  create  a proposal  for  a  collaborative  system which supports scientific production while facilitating that specialists know each other and work 
together  inside  and  outside  the  system:  the  iColleges.  For  that  purpose,  an  approach focused on the user is being used, where possible existing solutions are evaluated and on 
interacting  with  researchers  to  understand  their  needs,  transforming  them  into requirements,  creating  a  prototype  of  the  solution  and,  finally,  receiving  feedback  about 
what was created.  
The main contributions of this work are the report of the difficulties that researchers have  to  interact  with  each  other,  independent  of  their  geographical  proximity,  and  the 
development  of  a  collaborative  system  focused  on  scientific  development.  The  interface prototypes  of  iColleges  were  well-received  on  the  interviews  and  the  possibilities  for enhancements  for  the  system  are  innumerous,  as  well  as  its  possible  adaptations  for different contexts and areas of science. 


Keywords:  Collaborative  systems,  user  experience,  scientific  production,  ISO  13407.
