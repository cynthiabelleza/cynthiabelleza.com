Selling and buying movie licenses

<!--more-->

* **My role**: Scrum Master, Interaction Design

* **Employed by**: Recife Center for Advanced Studies and Systems (CESAR)

The world's second largest digital cinema company wanted software to allow licensors and licensees to sell and buy their movies online. With a team of three designers, two usability engineers and one project manager, we adopted the Scrum development process. This allowed us to delivery weekly releases and to gather more feedback from the client.

The interaction design concept defined by usability engineers through prototypes (e.g. paper, PowerPoint and Visio) is approved by the client – by telephone meetings – and possible changes are made before it is passed to the design team, who creates the art and implements the screens.
