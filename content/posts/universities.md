Benchmarking and testing four different university websites

<!--more-->

* **My role**: Benchmarking, Usability Coordination

* **Employed by**: Laboratory of Evaluation of Software Products (LAPS)

The project started as a request from a specializing student who wanted to compare four university websites for her thesis: Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), and Universidade de São Paulo (USP).

We separated the evaluation in three activities: benchmarking by the usability coordinator, user tests with questionnaires and a focus group. Ten users of distinct educational backgrounds, jobs and departments within the university appeared for the test.  

The test was conducted in a laboratory, with one computer per user. The users were instructed to answer the questionnaires comparing the websites and feeling free to criticize and suggest ways to do something better. After this, we joined the entire group in the same room and began the focus group with the presence of the student who asked for the evaluation – our client.
