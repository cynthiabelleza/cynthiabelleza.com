Redesign considering the users

<!--more-->

* **My role**: Information Architecture, User Experience Research 

* **Employed by**: Recife Center for Advanced Studies and Systems (CESAR)

More than five years ago, CESAR developed the Intranet. Since then, nobody thought about redesign until the beginning of this year. The design and communication teams decided to join together to investigate the user experience and propose a new interface.

Research was carried out with interviews of key persons of each area (e.g. Human resources, development, infrastructure etc.) by web messenger or in person. After that, we paper prototyped and defined information architecture in consensus with the data gathered. 

The system is currently on development and prototypes are being made.
