The usability evaluation process in LAPS

<!--more-->

* **My role**: Process Definition

* **Employed by**: Laboratory of Evaluation of Software Products (LAPS)

The Laboratory of evaluation of software products (LAPS) started in 2004 based on the necessity of evaluating software products besides the development processes. It counts on a highly qualified team of evaluators in software quality, software engineering and specialists in distinct areas of information technology.

I started working for LAPS in its beginning and my role was a leader in the usability area and specifying the usability evaluation process and to evolve it. Through this process, we used to receive a proposal for evaluation, establish an evaluation plan, execute the techniques and generate a report.

The process document was composed in accordance with the standards: ISO/IEC 9126, ISO/IEC 14598 and ISO/IEC 12119.
