A design process for the Central Brazilian Bank

<!--more-->

* **My role**: Process Definition, User Interviews

* **Employed by**: Recife Center for Advanced Studies and Systems (CESAR)

The Banco Central do Brasil is an autonomous federal institution and part of the National Financial System. The website is composed up of thousands of pages and is being redesigned for accessibility.

In this case, the design group of this project wanted a process to avoid rework and delays, which started to be common.  Through interviews with designers, analysts and project managers, we noticed that there was a communication problem between designers and analysts. The first ones didnâ€™t understand what were expected for the screens through textual requirements documents. Besides that, low feedback from the client collaborated in this problem just in the final delivery. 

Our proposal was to create a meeting to join designers, analysts and usability engineers in order to unify the understanding of the interface through paper prototyping beyond evolving this in a wireframe. This wireframe would be sent to the client, receive the approval and/or suggestions by them and turned into a web screen. In the first delivery, the client would focus on the interaction and information architecture while in next step would observe the visual identity. This process is still being used since we presented to the Bacen team.
