Process improvement with task analysis and use of MS Excel to control data and create dashboards

<!--more-->

* **My role**: Process Definition

* **Employed by**: National Council of Public Prosecutors (CNMP)

In the process of understanding new tasks and processes, I enjoy creating forms of controlling their steps and data, so it will be clear which action must be taken and use the information for reports subsequently.

Not having much access to financial means to acquire modern management tools, MS Excel is a viable and straightforward form of organizing, controlling, and analyzing information. Most of the managers at CNMP are familiar with the MS Suite but don't know how to use it to leverage data analysis.

In this context, I have been helping the HR and other sectors (such as Legal and Internal Affairs) to control their internal procedures. With that in mind, I interview them to understand how they work and what are their issues with the processes(sometimes through drawing a paper prototype in real-time). If they are open to suggestions, I make some changes to the process with the spreadsheet's first version. With this artifact, I meet them to consolidate and explain what I elaborated.

I still plan to learn more advanced topics in Excel, especially macros, but I am already overjoyed to help coworkers with what I already know.
