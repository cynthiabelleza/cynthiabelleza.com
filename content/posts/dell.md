Intern systems: redesign and proposal

<!--more-->

* **My role**: Interaction Design

* **Employed by**: Recife Center for Advanced Studies and Systems (CESAR)

My role in Dell was related to two projects: one to redesign an internal system and another to propose an interface. Both were done by paper prototyping and a series of interviews with key persons in the project about the software goals and constrains.
