Process definition for the project management sector 

<!--more-->

* **My role**: Process Definition

* **Employed by**:  State Information Technology Agency (ATI)/ Secretary of Social Defense (SDS)

When I was invited to work in SDS's Project Planning Division, I realized that the sector needed to understand which role it played in the organization. With this goal, I facilitated the elaboration of a strategic plan and the definition of internal processes. 
As the result of this work, the sector moved up the org chart, getting more attention and respect from the other sectors and State Secretaries.


Steps:
* Identify artifacts, clients, and stakeholders;
* Interview all clients and understand their necessities related to deliverables;
* Adapt our products to satisfy the discovered necessities;
* Interview some stakeholders to understand how they see the sector and what they expected from us;
* Test product prototypes with clients; 
* Review test results;
* Update products.
