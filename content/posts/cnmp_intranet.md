Elaboration of wireframes and prototypes to improve CNMP's HR Guide on the Intranet

<!--more-->

* **My role**: Information Architecture

* **Employed by**: National Council of Public Prosecutors (CNMP)

To increase the Human Resources Guide's visibility and searchability, we invited all the managers from different sectors from HR to describe the most asked questions and common difficulties they deal with day-to-day. With that information, we specified the new HR Guide's main topics and how they would appear on the intranet's front page.

At the moment, we are waiting for feedback from the Communications Sector to approve the proposed modifications, in order to collect metrics to evaluate the benefits of the new version.
