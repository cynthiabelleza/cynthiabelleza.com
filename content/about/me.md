Hi, I'm **Cynthia Pimentel Belleza Bernardino** (aka **Cynthia Belleza**).

With a background in Computer Science with focus in User-centered Design, I am fascinated by designing for interaction.

My passion for understanding the user needs started early, in the university, when I became with a hobby: evangelizing friends on user focus. Nowadays is difficult stay on a place or navigate on web and don’t came with a lot of complains about the experience and how that can be done in a better way.

This web porfolio is not intended to be an extensive list and, due to non-disclosure agreements, I can’t share detailed aspects.

I am currently based in Brazil and am looking for a full-time position in **information architecture**, **product design**, **user experience strategy and/or research**. If you have any questions about the projects included here or any other aspects of my professional experience, please feel free to contact me at any time.
